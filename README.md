# The Pizza Shack
TOP's Restuarant Project..

The goal of this project was to demonstrate using webpack
to build a single page website.

This project demonstrates building webpages dynamically
using Javascript, importing and exporting modules, and 
bundling using webpack.

The objective is to build this site with the above mentioned
skills. Not to design the website. With that said, I did
minimal design so that I can stay focused on the project
scope. I may or may not keep updating the site.

As of now, this project is considered finished.
